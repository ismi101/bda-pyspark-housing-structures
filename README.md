# Analyzing the Interplay of Housing Related Factors Across Varied Structure Types

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis of diverse housing-related factors and their interconnections across different structure types. The dataset under scrutiny is a comprehensive repository of
information capturing various dimensions of the housing landscape. It spans different geographic regions within America using the Housing Affordability Data System (HADS).

**Objectives**
1. Regional Housing Diversity:
- Investigate and document the distribution of housing structure types across various metropolitan areas (FMTMETRO3).
2. Ownership Patterns and Affordability:
- Explore the mix of homeowners and renters within different housing structures.
- Determine the average housing costs for distinct structure types.
3. Spatial Dynamics:
- Examine the average room counts in various housing structures.
- Establish connections with the fair market rent (FMR) to understand spatial considerations.
4. Financial Dynamics:
- Investigate the cost burden for different housing structures.
- Explore variations in average household costs and additional expenses.
5. Assistance Programs and Economic Disparities:
- Compare the distribution of assisted housing across different structure types.
- Investigate how the difference in housing costs relative to median income varies among different structure types.
6. Temporal Evolution:
- Study the changing distribution of housing structure types over the years, focusing on construction trends.
